## Scope and Trust Boundaries

```
[User at browser/terminal]

        v
[Vulos Frontend (JSX SPA)] <--- TLS ---> [Backend API (Go)]
        |                                       |
        v                                       v
[App Sandbox]                         [vumail Identity Store]
        |                                       |
        v                                       v
[OS Shell / init / firstboot]         [Signed squashfs / dm-verity]
```

Trust boundaries:
- **Browser ↔ Backend API**: authenticated session (cookie/token). Untrusted input from browser.
- **Backend API ↔ OS Shell**: privileged local IPC. Attacker who reaches this can escalate.
- **Squashfs image**: trusted only if dm-verity hash matches baked key.
- **App Sandbox ↔ OS**: sandbox syscall filter is the boundary; escaping it reaches OS.

---

## Component 1: OS Shell and Firstboot Installer

### Trust boundaries
- Firstboot runs as root. User input (hostname, disk selection) flows into shell commands and partition operations.
- Network is reachable during firstboot (for package fetch, time sync).

### Top 3 STRIDE threats

| # | Category | Threat |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Tampering** | Attacker replaces squashfs image on the boot medium with a backdoored version before dm-verity is active. |
| 2 | **Elevation of Privilege** | Firstboot installer evaluates user-supplied hostname without sanitisation, leading to command injection in shell wrappers. |
| 3 | **Spoofing** | MITM on firstboot network fetch substitutes a malicious image payload before signature verification. |

### Mitigations in code
- dm-verity hash baked at build time; kernel refuses to mount tampered root.
- Signed squashfs verified before mount in initramfs (see `scripts/verify-image`).
- Hostname input validated against `[a-zA-Z0-9\-]{1,63}` regex in firstboot handler.

### Residual risks
- Key rotation for the baked dm-verity trust key is an open design question (see memory/vulos-os-distribution-architecture.md).
- Network fetch during firstboot has no certificate pinning; relies on system CA bundle which may be stale on older boot media.

## Component 2: vumail Identity Management

### Trust boundaries
- Identity data (email address, keys) stored in local SQLite, accessed only by backend API.
- External: Vulos Cloud verifies identity binding over HTTPS.

### Top 3 STRIDE threats

| # | Category | Threat |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Spoofing** | Attacker crafts a malformed identity assertion to impersonate another Vulos user during cloud sync. |
| 2 | **Information Disclosure** | SQLite identity store readable by another app if sandbox boundary is not enforced. |
| 3 | **Repudiation** | No audit log of identity-change events; user disputes key rotation they didn't authorise. |

### Mitigations in code
- Identity assertions are signed; cloud verifies signature before accepting.
- SQLite file permissions: `0600`, owned by the backend process user.
- CGO disabled; no SQLite C library — pure-Go driver reduces attack surface.

### Residual risks
- Audit log for identity changes not yet implemented (tracked in tasks.md AUTH area).
- Key rotation UX is manual; users may skip rotation after compromise.

## Component 3: App Sandbox

### Trust boundaries
- Each installed app runs in a seccomp-filtered process.
- App ↔ Backend API: HTTP over loopback, authenticated per-app token.
- App cannot directly reach other apps' data directories.

### Top 3 STRIDE threats

| # | Category | Threat |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Elevation of Privilege** | Seccomp filter gap allows a malicious app to call a restricted syscall (e.g. `ptrace`, `mount`) and escape the sandbox. |
| 2 | **Tampering** | Malicious app writes to another app's data directory by exploiting a path-traversal in the backend's file API. |
| 3 | **Information Disclosure** | App reads `/proc` or environment variables of sibling processes before sandbox is fully applied. |

### Mitigations in code
- Seccomp allowlist is default-deny; only safe syscalls permitted.
- Backend file API resolves paths under `JAIL_ROOT` and rejects `..` traversal.
- App process launched with distinct UID per sandbox instance (where OS supports it).

### Residual risks
- Seccomp filter completeness depends on the kernel version; old kernels may lack certain enforcement.
- App-registry trust (whether an app package is signed) is not yet enforced end-to-end (tracked in APPSTORE tasks).

---

## Overall Residual Risks

1. dm-verity key rotation protocol is unspecified — a compromised build key requires a re-image.
2. No intrusion detection or integrity monitoring at runtime (post-boot).
3. Audit logging coverage is incomplete across identity and sandbox events.
